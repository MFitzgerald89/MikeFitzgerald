# Hi, I'm Mike!

I am currently a student at Actualize Coding Bootcamp and I am loving it!

I have recently finished my personal website and if you're interested, you can check it out here michealcfitzgerald.com

I am also working on a mobile dating app for my graduation project and as soon as I get a good bit of design and function to it, I'd love to hear some feedback!
